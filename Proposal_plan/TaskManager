Week 10: Project Mapping

We started off by figuring what the topic our project would be. We debated on a few ideas- one which was a personal inventory management
application, and the other was the one we had finalised. Both of our ideas had the same concept to get user input and then to provide them w
with the required data. As we discussed, we realised that we wanted to give our project a multicultural focus, and wanted our efforts to 
focus on that. We, then worked on the flow of the project understanding what are the specifications from the user and the creator perspective.
