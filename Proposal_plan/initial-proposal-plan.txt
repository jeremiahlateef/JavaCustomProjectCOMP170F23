Proposal Idea for COMP 170
Food
User Perspective
1.	A user opens the site
2.	Then the user is welcomed with a statement: The statement welcomes the user and states the mission of the project. 
3.	The user is asked a series of questions.
4.	The user input their answer to each question
5.	The user answers will result in a tailored response that is suits their taste. 

Programmer perspective
1.	We write a statement that welcomes the user and informs them of the objective of the site. (print statement)
2.	The user is asked three questions. 
3.	The response must be a string. Use Scanner Method for this
4.	Throw an error if the user submits a data type that is not a String or that is not among the option
5.	Tell the user to reenter their response if they give an illegal response. 
6.	We store the user response in variables. 
7.	Save all three responses in a variable. 
8.	Use loop to query the database 


Store the data as an array. If the user chooses peanut

Team Proposal Plan
Project Title- Multicultural Menu

Project Definition-

Food and cuisine hold a deeply personal and significant place in our lives. What we consume not only sustains us but also mirrors our cultural heritage and individual preferences. While there exist numerous websites and applications that help users generate recipes based on available ingredients, a critical aspect often remains overlooked - the ability to tailor these recipes according to one's specific culinary inclinations. For example, when we talk about 'Asian' cuisine, it encompasses a diverse array of food from regions such as India, Korea, China, and Japan.

With our project, we aim to rectify this gap by presenting a multicultural perspective. We intend to create a database of dishes from Asia, Africa, and Europe. Our platform will allow users to select their preferred cuisine, accommodate any dietary restrictions or allergies they might have, and even align with their food preferences, be it vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, or omnivore. The users will then receive customized recipes tailored to their choices.

To enhance the user experience by incorporating interesting trivia and fun facts with the intention to not only explore explore the origin of these dishes but also gain valuable insights into the art of cooking.

Team or Individual
This project will be built by a team of three individuals- Alberta Ayitey, Jeremiah Lateef, Shwetha Vaidyanathan.

Design

The user will be asked a series of questions and be prompted to choose from a series of options. For instance, the user will be asked to choose from four regional nationalities: Asian, African, European, and Caribbean. Each region will be represented by A, B, C, and D. The user will have to choose an option within the specified categories to proceed to the next question. In similar manner, the user will be prompted with at least two questions. These responses will determine the dishes that will be presented to them.
There will be a JSON file that stores the data of all the dishes. The input from the users will be used to query the JSON file to return dishes that aligns with the user's choices. There will be a focus on user friendly design with clear presentations.



Schedule:

Week 10: Project Mapping

We started off by figuring out the best topic and structure of our project. We debated on a few ideas; one was a personal inventory management application, and the other was the one we had finalized. Both of our ideas had the same concept to get user's input and then to provide them with the required data. As we discussed, we realized that we wanted to give our project a multicultural focus. We then worked out the flow of the project understanding user's perspectives and the methodology to achieve it. We also created a GitHub repository to manage the project.


Week 11: Code Implementation

We will divide up and collect the recipe data for the different cuisines which are; African, Asian, Caribbean, and European. We will ensure that we will create the database that can work seamlessly with a specified set of parameters. We will create the wireframe of the project, so that we can gear up for conducting the test trials over the upcoming weeks. We will draft our inital code for the program.

Week 12: Review and Research

We will continue the coding process, while also implementing all the design elements based on our wireframe. We will then
attempt to link the JSON file to the input of the users. We will document our changes on GitHub. We will also work closely with faculty, and TA's to get our queries resolved.

Week 13: Feedback and Corrections

We will have the basic elements of the program sorted by this time. We will now dwell on ensuring that all the data will interact with the JSON file to produce the necessary output. We will also begin testing the program with family and friends to get their feedback and ideas in terms of design, and structure in our decision. 

Week 14: Completion of Project

We will work on the bugs in the program, and continue testing it with family and friends. We will be taking the final round of feedback to make changes to the design elements. We will then finalize the program and make it ready for presentation.


 
Testing: 

We will test the program as a group by performing comprehensive testing. We will deploy the application to a production setting, and ask some users to use the program. Each user will provide essential feedback on the usability and accessibility. We will use the feedback to improve the syntax, and correct errors if required. 

The user will be prompted to answer a pre-defined set of questions that can only receive a single, unique response. The user input will be accessed on its appropriateness. An error will be thrown if the user provides an incompatible answer. The user will be prompted to provide another response if their earlier input does not meet the conditions.

The data for the culinary dishes will be stored in a JSON file. We will ensure the data in the data file can be accessed in the main program after meeting certain conditions.
